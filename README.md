# Basketball Team Stats Tool
In this project you will be writing a program that reads from the "constants" data (`PLAYERS` and `TEAMS`) in `constants.py`. This data will need to be translated into a new collection of your choosing and the fields need to be changed to something that makes more sense for Python to do its comparisons.
